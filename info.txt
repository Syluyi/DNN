Project for creating a DNN classifier for vowels and consonants for the CGN corpus and visualising the output in the different layers of the network. 

This project uses python 3.5.3 and tensorflow 1.2.1

folders:
- preprocessing: code for creating input features from the CGN data
- preprocessing_spectro: code for adding spectrogram data to the input features
- training: code for training a DNN on classifying vowels and consonants
- visualizing: code for visualizing the output in the different layers of the network
- data: necessary data

The CGN corpus can be found at http://lands.let.ru.nl/cgn/
